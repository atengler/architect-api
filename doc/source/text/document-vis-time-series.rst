Time-series Visualizations
==========================


Line Chart
==========

A *line chart* or *line graph* is a type of chart which displays information
as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line
segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is similar to
a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by
their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is
often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series
– thus the line is often drawn chronologically. In these cases they are known
as run charts.

Area Chart
==========

An *area chart* or *area graph* displays graphically quantitative data. It is
based on the line chart. The area between axis and line are commonly
emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings. Commonly one compares with an
area chart two or more quantities.

Area charts which use vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points
in a series forming a step-like progression are called step-area charts.

Area charts in which data points are connected by smooth curves instead of
straight lines are called *spline-area charts*.

Radar Chart
===========

A *radar chart* is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the
form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables
represented on axes starting from the same point. The relative position and
angle of the axes is typically uninformative.

The *radar chart* is also known as *web chart*, *spider chart*, *star chart*,
*star plot*, *cobweb chart*, *irregular polygon*, *polar chart*, or *Kiviat
diagram*. It is equivalent to a parallel coordinates plot in polar
coordinates.

Bar Chart
=========

A *bar chart* or *bar graph* is a chart or graph that presents categorical
data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values
that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.

A bar graph shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart
shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a
measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than
one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.

Bar graphs can also be used for more complex comparisons of data with grouped
bar charts and stacked bar charts. In a *grouped bar chart*, for each
categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to
represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores
might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each
store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical
axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a *stacked bar chart* could be
used. The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top
of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of
the groups. However, stacked bar charts are not suited to datasets where some
groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable.

Calendar Heat Map
=================

A *heat map* (or *heatmap*) is a graphical representation of data where the
individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. The term
'heat map' was originally coined and trademarked by software designer Cormac
Kinney in 1991, to describe a 2D display depicting financial market
information, though similar plots such as shading matrices have existed for
over a century.
