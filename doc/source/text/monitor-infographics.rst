Graphs are frequently drawn as ``node-link diagrams`` in which the vertices
are represented as disks, boxes, or textual labels and the edges are
represented as line segments, polylines, or curves in the Euclidean plane.

Node-link diagrams can be traced back to the 13th century work of Ramon Llull,
who drew diagrams of this type for complete graphs in order to analyze all
pairwise combinations among sets of metaphysical concepts.
