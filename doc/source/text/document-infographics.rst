Visual Infographics
===================

It is useful to identify three main categories of data visualizations in terms
of what their main (intended or unintended) purpose is.

**Inspirational**

    The main goal here is to inspire people. To *wow* them! But not just on a
    superficial level, but to really engage people into deeper thinking, sense
    of beauty and awe. Visualization has an incredible power to attract
    peopleâ€™s attention but also to draw them into fantastic artificial worlds
    that turn abstract concept into more tangible ones.

**Explanatory**

    The main goal here is to use graphics as a way to explain some complex
    idea, phenomenon or process. This is an area where graphical
    representation shines: we are visual creatures and a picture is sometime
    really worth a thousand words.

**Analytical**

    The main goal here is to extract information out of data with the purpose
    of answering questions and advancing understanding of some phenomenon of
    interest. Sure, explanatory visualization is also about helping people
    understand something.

    But the main difference here is that in *explanatory visualization* the
    author knows already what to visualize (after having performed some
    analysis), whereas in analysis the main use of visualization is to
    understand the data in the first place.

Data analysis is important because it can help people improve their
understanding of complex phenomena in our case service models and can help
solve important problems around it. It's an indirect link, but an important
one: *If I understand a problem better, there are higher chances I can find a
better solution for it*.
