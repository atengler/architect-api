DAG Visualizations
==================

A directed acyclic graph (DAG), is a finite directed graph with no directed
cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with each
edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start
at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that
eventually loops back to v again. Equivalently, a DAG is a directed graph that
has a topological ordering, a sequence of the vertices such that every edge is
directed from earlier to later in the sequence.


Layered Graph
=============

*Layered graph drawing* or *hierarchical graph drawing* is a type of graph
drawing in which the vertices of a directed graph are drawn in horizontal rows
or layers with the edges generally directed downwards. It is also known as
*Sugiyama-style graph drawing* after Kozo Sugiyama, who first developed this
drawing style.
