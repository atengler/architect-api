Numerical Visualizations

Progress Bar
============

A *progress bar* is a graphical control element used to visualize the
progression of an extended computer operation, such as a download, file
transfer, or installation. Sometimes, the graphic is accompanied by a textual
representation of the progress in a percent format.

The concept of a progress bar was invented before digital computing. In 1896
Karol Adamiecki developed a chart which he called a harmonogram, which is
better known today as a Gantt chart. Adamiecki did not publish his chart until
1931, however, and then only in Polish. The chart thus now bears the name of
Henry Gantt (1861â€“1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910-1915 and
popularized it in the west.

Gauge
=====

A *gauge* or *gage*, in science and engineering, is a device used to make
measurements or in order to display certain dimensional information. A wide
variety of tools exist which serve such functions, ranging from simple pieces
of material against which sizes can be measured to complex pieces of
machinery. Depending on usage, a gauge can be described as "a device for
measuring and displaying a physical quantity",

Pie Chart, Doughnut Chart
=========================

A *pie chart* (or a *circle chart*) is a circular statistical graphic which is
divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the
arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is
proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its
resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it
can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to
William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801.

A *3d pie cake*, or *perspective pie cake*, is used to give the chart a 3D
look. Often used for aesthetic reasons, the third dimension does not improve
the reading of the data; on the contrary, these plots are difficult to
interpret because of the distorted effect of perspective associated with the
third dimension. The use of superfluous dimensions not used to display the
data of interest is discouraged for charts in general, not only for pie
charts.

A *doughnut chart* (also spelled *donut*) is a variant of the pie chart, with
a blank center allowing for additional information about the data as a whole
to be included. Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts in that their aim is
to illustrate proportions. This type of circular graph can support multiple
statistics at once and it provides a better data intensity ratio to standard
pie charts.

The *polar area diagram* is similar to a usual pie chart, except sectors have
equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from the center
of the circle. The polar area diagram is used to plot cyclic phenomena (e.g.,
counts of deaths by month). For example, if the counts of deaths in each month
for a year are to be plotted then there will be 12 sectors (one per month) all
with the same angle of 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector would be
proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area
of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month. If the death count in
each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple
comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram famously
developed by Florence Nightingale.

A *ring chart*, also known as a *sunburst chart* or a *multilevel pie chart*,
is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. The
circle in the centre represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving
outward from the center. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical
relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the
angular sweep of the parent segment.

A *spie chart* comparing number of students with student costs across four
different schools A variant of the polar area chart is the spie chart designed
by Dror Feitelson. This superimposes a normal pie chart with a modified polar
area chart to permit the comparison of two sets of related data. The base pie
chart represents the first data set in the usual way, with different slice
sizes. The second set is represented by the superimposed polar area chart,
using the same angles as the base, and adjusting the radii to fit the data.
For example, the base pie chart could show the distribution of age and gender
groups in a population, and the overlay their representation among road
casualties. Age and gender groups that are especially susceptible to being
involved in accidents then stand out as slices that extend beyond the original
pie chart.

The *square charts* are a rare form of pie charts that use squares instead of
circles to represent percentages. Similar to basic circular pie charts, square
pie charts take each percentage out of a total 100%.

Bullet Graph
============

A *bullet graph* is a variation of a bar graph developed by Stephen Few.
Seemingly inspired by the traditional thermometer charts and progress bars
found in many dashboards, the bullet graph serves as a replacement for
dashboard gauges and meters. Bullet graphs were developed to overcome the
fundamental issues of gauges and meters: they typically display too little
information, require too much space, and are cluttered with useless and
distracting decoration. The bullet graph features a single, primary measure
(for example, current year-to-date revenue), compares that measure to one or
more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target),
and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as
poor, satisfactory, and good. The qualitative ranges are displayed as varying
intensities of a single hue to make them discernible by those who are color
blind and to restrict the use of colors on the dashboard to a minimum.

Isotype
=======

*Isotype* (International System Of Typographic Picture Education) is a method of
showing social, technological, biological and historical connections in
pictorial form. It consisted of a set of standardized and abstracted pictorial
symbols to represent social-scientific data with specific guidelines on how to
combine the identical figures using serial repetition.
