Architect Introduction
======================

The aim of this project is to provide unified service modeling, management and
visualization platform agnostic of delivery method. It creates virtual
representations of any software services or physical resources and allows
control over their entire life-cycle. The name of project comes from Architect
program in Matrix movie series:

    In the Matrix the Architect is a highly specialized, humorless program of
    the machine world as well as the creator of the Matrix. As the chief
    administrator of the system, he is possibly a collective manifestation, or
    at the very least a virtual representation of the entire Machine
    mainframe.

The The Architect project was started as part of my thesis "Visualization of
cloud performace metrics". Now we explore the possible implications of
combining the relational models of infrastructures with quantitative data that
relates to it.
